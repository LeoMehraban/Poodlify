# Poodlify
A game in Processing that I coded in two hours

You play as a lone poodle in a world of other types of dogs

There are 20 other dogs nearby, and you need to turn them into poodles so you can have friends

Touch a dog and press space to turn them into a poodle (or Poodlify them, if you want to use that term)

The dogs are controled by random numbers. at a random amount of time, they will switch to a new random speed

Use the arrow keys to move around, and the space key to Poodlify dogs
